# Basic Fixtures

These fixtures test basic schema functionality: Simple strings,
integers, numbers, nulls, required fields, enums. These are nice,
generic data schemas that can be used to test application functionality.

These fixtures will test in the future:

* readOnly
* validations (minLength, maxLength, pattern, minimum, maximum, etc...)
* x-hidden
* x-ignore
* x-order
* default
* title
* description
* x-view-url
* x-view-item-url

These fixtures will not test advanced schema features that require
special processing or JavaScript, like:

* x-id-field
* date-time
* foreign keys (see foreign-key-field)
* markdown
* arrays
* booleans (yes/no)
* file paths / uploads
* read_schema
